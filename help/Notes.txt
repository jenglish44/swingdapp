Original Notes

Game

1. Do we need the following element: “My Team is home/My Team is visiting team”?
Scenarios
User has NOT set batting order - This element needed if 
2. Change Hitter element to read-only (user can’t use this element to enter new hitter name)
3. During game, batter has not completed their at-bat and, due to injury or something else, this batter is replaced with another player. The new batter inherits the count of the batter he replaced.  Currently, the app restarts count when new batter comes into game. This is not important enough for version 1, if ever!
 
Practice

Add "UPLOAD" button to cageform.html and maybe pitch.html.  Is database ready to store batting practice data?
NEW TEAM button opens in same window as app and user unable to return to app without reopening it.

1. change Cage Practice to Batting Practice in slider menu
2. team selection to include “Other”, which lets user enter player name. [next version]
3. Link/button for user to create team
4. Summary, can we include like game data summary? [next button]
5. Back button needs to be checked. 

new
1.  Query about pitch.html.  Could we include player name (last name if fine) to right of PITCH #?  For example, PITCH 1: English.
2.  After each player has their turn, can “Team” selection default to the previously selected team?



General
1. Is practice and game data stored on phone?  Does upload button send both practice and game data to web db?
2. External links must open in native browser.  These currently open is app window trapping user with no way back to app.
