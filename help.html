                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The overall focus of SwingD is to allow its users to determine whether a hitter or team of hitters is able to efficiently react to pitches and the percentage of time a hitter is able to hit the ball hard. Simple logic and game data both indicate that hitters are more likely to hit a ball hard if they swing at strikes and do not swing at balls. Data from major league baseball clearly shows that the harder a ball is hit the more likely a hitter will get on base. Teams that are able to draw more walks (not swinging at balls), strike out less often, and hit the ball harder score more runs.
                    </p>
                    <p>The overall SwingD process can be summed up in three general steps. </p>
                    <ol type="a">
                      <li>Record hitting performance. The SwingD app allows game and batting practice performance to be recorded.. </li>
                      <li>Send data for analysis by using the Upload link provided inside SwingD app.</li>
                      <li>View reports by logging in at <a href="https://www.swingd.com/swingadmin" class="external" target="_system">www.swingd.com/swingadmin</a> and clicking reports.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Studying the information provided here will help you become familiar with how to perform these three vital steps.</p>

						<ol type="a">
                        	<li>First, you must first create the team then add its roster at SwingD website located at <a href="https://www.swingd.com/swingadmin" class="external">www.swingd.com/swingadmin</a>.  Use your SwingD login to access this website.</li>
                            <li>Once you have created the team and its roster, you can return to SwingD app and navigate to Batting Lineup.  The team name should now appear in Team select list.  If not, reload SwingD app with an Internet connection.  The team name will remain available in the Team select list until it is deleted, which can only be done at <a href="https://www.swingd.com/swingadmin" class="external">www.swingd.com/swingadmin</a>.</li>
                            <li>After a team is selected their roster will appear and allow batting order values to be assigned to each player on entire roster.  Enter a value for each player on roster.  Two critical items to keep in mind: (1) all players on roster must be assigned a unique batting order value and (2) players assigned the nine (9) lowest values (typically 1-9) will start game.</li>
                            <li>A team’s batting order will be changed when substituting to allow player entering game to bat in correct order.</li>
                            <li>It is recommended to check batting order before the start of each game.</li>

                            <li>Each player on entire roster must have unique batting order number.</li>
                            <li>During game the batting order restarts at first batter after 9th batter.</li>
                            <li>Substituting can be done during game for any player coming to the plate.  Use the Batter button located at bottom of game recorder to substitute.</li>

<p><strong>TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT</strong></p>
<p><em>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SITES, APPS AND SERVICES YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  IF YOU DO NOT EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THEN PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USER OUR SITES, APPS OR SERVICES.  THIS TERMS OF SERVICE IS EFFECTIVE AS OF 1/1/2016. </em></p>
<p><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</strong></p>
<p>The following Terms of Service Agreement (the “TOS”) is a legally binding agreement that shall govern the relationship with our users and others which may interact or interface with SwingD LLC, also known as SwingD, located at 1000 Sunnyview Lane, Frankfort, Kentucky 40601, and our subsidiarieis and affiliates, in association with the use of the SwingD website and apps, which includes https://www.swingd.com (the “Site”) and SwingD (the “App”) and its Services, which shall be defined below.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WEBSITE AND APP SERVICES OFFERED</strong></p>
<p>The Site and App are sports analytics properties which have the following description:</p>
<p>The overall focus of SwingD is to allow its users to determine whether a hitter or team of hitters is able to efficiently react to pitches and the percentage of time a hitter is able to hit the ball hard.  Simple logic and game data both indicate that hitters are more likely to hit a ball hard if they swing at strikes and do not swing at balls. Data from major league baseball clearly shows that the harder a ball is hit the more likely a hitter will get on base. Teams that are able to draw more walks (not swinging at balls), strike out less often, and hit the ball harder score more runs.</p>
<p>Any and all visitors to our site , despite whether they are registered or not, shall be deemed as "users" of the herein contained Services provided for the purpose of this TOS. Once an individual registers for our Services, through the process of creating an account, the user shall then be considered a "member."</p>
<p>The user and/or member acknowledges and agrees that the Services provided and made available through our website and applications, which may include some mobile applications and that those applications may be made available on various social media networking sites and numerous other platforms and downloadable programs, are the sole property of SwingD LLC. At its discretion, SwingD LLC may offer additional website Services and/or products, or update, modify or revise any current content and Services, and this Agreement shall apply to any and all additional Services and/or products and any and all updated, modified or revised Services unless otherwise stipulated. SwingD LLC does hereby reserve the right to cancel and cease offering any of the aforementioned Services and/or products. You, as the end user and/or member , acknowledge, accept and agree that SwingD LLC shall not be held liable for any such updates, modifications, revisions, suspensions or discontinuance of any of our Services and/or products. Your continued use of the Services provided, after such posting of any updates, changes, and/or modifications shall constitute your acceptance of such updates, changes and/or modifications, and as such, frequent review of this Agreement and any and all applicable terms and policies should be made by you to ensure you are aware of all terms and policies currently in effect. Should you not agree to the updated, modified, revised or modified terms, you must stop using the provided Services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the user and/or member understands, acknowledges and agrees that the Services offered shall be provided "AS IS" and as such SwingD LLC shall not assume any responsibility or obligation for the timeliness, missed delivery, deletion and/or any failure to store user content, communication or personalization settings.</p>

The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br></div><div class='innerText'><br><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></div><div class='innerText'>Users can visit our site anonymously</div><div class='innerText'>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</div><div class='innerText'>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</div><div class='innerText'><br>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</div><div class='innerText'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page</div><div class='innerText'>Users are able to change their personal information:</div><div class='innerText'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> By emailing us</div><div class='innerText'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>&bull;</strong> By logging in to their account</div><div class='innerText'><br><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></div><div class='innerText'>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. </div><div class='innerText'><br><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></div><div class='innerText'>It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</div><span id='coppAct'></span><br><div class='blueText'><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
